Novak Djokovic (Serbian Cyrillic: Новак Ђоковић, romanized: Novak
Đoković, pronounced born 22 May 1987) is a Serbian professional tennis
player. He is currently ranked world No. 7 in singles by the Association of
Tennis Professionals (ATP). He has been ranked world No. 1 for a record total
373 weeks,and has finished as the year-end No. 1 a record seven times.[8] He
has won 21 Grand Slam men's singles titles, including a record nine Australian
Open titles. Overall, he has won 88 ATP singles titles, which include a record
64 Big Titles and a record 38 Masters titles. Djokovic is the first and only
man in tennis history to be the reigning champion of the four majors at once
across three different surfaces. He is the only man to complete a non-calendar
year Grand Slam in the Open Era and the first to achieve a double Career Grand
Slam. He is also the only player to complete the Career Golden Masters on the
ATP Tour, which he has done twice.
Djokovic began his professional career in 2003. At age 20, he
disrupted Roger Federer's and Rafael Nadal's streak of 11 consecutive majors
to win his first major title at the 2008 Australian Open. By 2010, Djokovic
also separated himself from the rest of field to join Federer and Nadal in the
Big Three, the group of three players who have dominated men's tennis for more

than a decade.In 2011, Djokovic ascended to No. 1 for the first time, winning
three out of the four majors and a then-season record of five Masters events.
He remained the best player in men's tennis for the rest of the decade,
leading the tour in winning the Grand Slam, Masters and Year-end Championship
titles. In 2015, Djokovic reached fifteen consecutive finals winning three
majors and a season-record of six Masters events as well as the ATP Finals.
The following year, he won the 2016 French Open to become the only man in the
Open Era to complete a non-calendar year Grand Slam and his first Career Grand
Slam. He became the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to hold all four major
titles at once and the only one in history to do so on three different
surfaces. During the decade, Djokovic finished as No. 1 for six years and No.
2 for three other years, and in 2021 he set the records for both most weeks
spent as world No. 1 and most year-end No. 1 finishes.
Representing Serbia, Djokovic led the Serbian national team to their
first Davis Cup title in 2010 and to the inaugural ATP Cup title in 2020.
Moreover, he won the bronze medal for Serbia at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
Djokovic has won the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year award four times
(2012, 2015, 2016, 2019), the BBC Sports Personality World Sport Star of the
Year award in 2011 and the L'Équipe Champion of Champions award in 2021. He is
also a recipient of the Order of St. Sava, the Order of Karađorđe's Star, and
the Order of the Republika Srpska.
Beyond competition, Djokovic is an active philanthropist and a former
ATP player council president.In August 2020, Djokovic and Vasek Pospisil
announced the formation of the Professional Tennis Players Association as the
first player-only association in tennis, citing the need for players to have
more influence on the tour and advocating better prize money structure for
lower ranked players.
